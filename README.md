## Environment Configuration

The root directory of your application, contain a .env.example file. You should copy the file with .env. Your .env file should not be committed to your application's source control, since each developer / server using your application could require a different environment configuration.

## Quick start

1. Make sure that you have Node.js v10 or later and npm v5 or above installed.

2. Clone this repo using `git clone https://github.com/ReactConf/nextjs-boilerplate-reactconf-ir2020.git`
